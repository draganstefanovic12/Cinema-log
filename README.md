# Cinema Log

Website I created using the MERN stack that allows users to add media (Movies/TV Shows) to their profile, users can also add media to the watchlist if they see something they like. There's also an option to follow other users, create custom lists, recommend media to other users, like other users lists and many more.

I've set up an authorization too using JWT and I'm using bcrypt to hash and salt the passwords. 

There's a lot of work left, small details and animations and I'll keep working on it until I feel it's good enough. For now, I feel it looks nice enough to publish.

Come check out the site and recommend me some movies, my username is dragan
