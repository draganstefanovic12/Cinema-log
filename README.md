# Cinema Log

Website I created using the MERN stack that allows users to add media (Movies/TV Shows) to their watched/watchlists. There's also an option to follow other users, create custom lists, recommend media to other users, like other users lists and many more.

I've set up an authorization too using JWT and I'm using bcrypt to hash and salt the passwords.
